# `playground`
Welcome to `playground` ðŸŽ‰

`playground` is a simple container that offers an ephemeral playground/scratch space. It has a hook for a custom setup
script as well as a runloop script. Furthermore, the base image can be selected via the `Docker-Compose.yml`-file, if
you build the container manually.


## Example
See the [Docker-Compose.yml](Docker-Compose.yml) file as example.
